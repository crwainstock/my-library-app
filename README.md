## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Dependencies

This application fetches data from the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/overview). In order to use the API appropriately, you need to follow the instructions in the Google Books API documentation to create and use an API key.

You can find information about [getting started with the Google Books API here](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/getting_started). And you can read more about the two different [ways to authorize requests and identifying your application here](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using#auth). This application was built with the API Key version of authorization and identification, but you also have the option to use OAuth 2.0 tokens.

[This section of the documentation](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using#WorkingVolumes) has some great examples of how to search for different types of data with the API.

Other dependencies include:

- [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/toast) -- specifically, I used the Toast primitive component
-

Other tech notes:

- [Truncating text with CSS](https://benmarshall.me/css-limit-text-length/)
